== Overview ==
This agent enable you to query files at /var/status/*.status, which corrosponds to active processes.
status files are to be written by procses, and are a simple key=value list, for example:

	$ cat /var/status/13619.status 
	binary=/usr/sbin/rsyslogd
	pid=13148
	time=1317738495
	function=some_function
	status=Some status
	key_1=value
	...
	key_n=value

The following keys are important:
	pid : the process id
	binary : the process binary (used to validate the the pid actually runs this binary)
	time : unixtime of the update (seconds since 1/1/1970), this is used with the elapsed query (below).

The rest of the keys are free key=value pairs which can be queries freely.

== Usage == 
	the status agent supports the following operations:
		query	: returns matching processes (default operation)
		kill	: kill matching processes

Key based filtering:
To queries all processes with rsyslog binary:
	$ mco status query binary=rsyslog
query is optional and can be omitted:
	$ mco status binary=rsyslog

you may combine multiple key-value pairs, and only processes matching all of them will be teturned:
	$ mco status binary=rsyslog function=download

Time based filtering:
	$ mco status elapsed=10m
will match all processes where the status file timestamp field 10 minutes old or older.
supported format is n[s|m|h|d] for seconds,minutes,hours,days - where the default is seconds.

You can of course combine time based filtering with key based filtering:
	$ mco status elapsed=10m function=download
will match all status files with function=download which are older than 10 minutes.

== Installation ==
	Copy the agent, application and util directories into mcollective plugins dir (/usr/share/mcollective/plugins/mcollective/ on debian)

== Misc ==
The included file scrub-status is used to delete dead status files (written by processes which are no longer running).
While the agent ignores those files, its better to not let them pile up in /var/status, so its recommended to run scrub-status in a cron job.
